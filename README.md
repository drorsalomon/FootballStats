Footballstats is a website that provides up to date information and statistics about football leagues, teams and players. 

How it works? 

1.	Choose between six major football leagues (Bundesliga – Germany, La Liga – Spain, Ligat Ha’al – Israel, Ligue 1 – France, 
Premier League – England, Serie A – Italy) from the drop down button in the navigation bar.
2.	Choose a team from the chosen league.
3.	Choose a player from the chosen team.

You can also scroll between different seasons of the chosen team and get player statistics from that season. 

Looking for a player but not sure at which team he’s playing? After selecting a league, you can type the players name in the 
search field and get statistics from the chosen season. 

You may also add your favorite players to the favorites list for faster engagement when you revisit the website.

Footballstats was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with the help of external libraries like Bootstrap 5, axios, chart.js and parcel. 
The structure of the project adheres to the MVC design pattern and features a model (model.js) which interacts with the data API, view files (in the views folder) 
which render the data to the webpage and a controller (controller.js) for managing the data coming from the API and the data rendering via the view files. 
Also, I've used the JavaScript ES6 classes templates for managing the different view files.
